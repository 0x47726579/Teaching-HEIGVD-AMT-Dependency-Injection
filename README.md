# Dependency Injection

This repo contains code to study the notion of "dependency injection" from the ground up, without any framework.

## What do we have in the code?

We have a "pseudo system", which allows us to create a fisherman. We can ask the fisherman to get some fish for us. To do that, he will need some equipment: boots, a boat, bait and of course a fishing rod. It's a wonderful world: whenever the fisherman uses his fishing rod, he will get fresh fish.

We have a unit test that validates the behavior of the system. Let's fix the problem!

## Phase 1

* Fork the repo
* Open the project in the IDE
* Run the test and see it fail
* Read the code

##Phase 2

* Fix the code to make the test pass
* Open a pull request

##Phase 3

* Review the solutions
* Introduce the notion of dependency injection
